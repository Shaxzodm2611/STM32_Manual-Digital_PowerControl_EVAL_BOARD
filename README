# STM32 Motor Controller

A custom PCB project that utlizies a stand-alone 32bit STM32 MCU (exact model can be found in BOM). The purpose of the project is to continue building upon my PCB and soldering skills aswell as
help me learn embedded C development as well as the CubeIDE.

 ## Features

- 7-Seven Seg visual output for Debug/feedback to user input
- Digital/Rotrary Pot to test/enable a variable voltage output (frm buck set-up)
- Temperature sensor as well as an EEPROM to get used to I2C drivers as well as writing/reading memory
- 3 Shift registers corresponding with the seven-segs so that I can practice with STM32 timers/retimers

 ## REP Struct

 - "hardware/" - Schematic, PCB, Gerber + Additional .pcbLib, .schLib, etc (Altium)
 - "firmware/" - STM32 Proj. File
 - "docs/" - Design notes + Sim + Plots + (potential) write-up/LateX source


 ## MISC
 - Nothing yet
